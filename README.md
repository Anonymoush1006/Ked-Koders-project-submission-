In this project: we have implemented AI into healthcare, through generating the potential treatments, diagnosis, as well as the illness itself. This completely erases the need for doctors as a whole, because you can simply pick up the medicine as you have the diagnosis. This is the future of healthcare.
How to use it- Put your illness/symptoms into the input box so ai can generate treatment and solution. 
For example, You can type 'treatments for cancer' into the search box and ai will generate hospitals, causes, and treatments for cancer
