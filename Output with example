treatment for a headache and anxiety that was found to differ between individuals with and without the hormone testosterone or polymorphisms.

Testicular testosterone-dependent symptoms, symptoms with increased body fat after treatment, and increased serum testosterone concentrations after 12-week abstinence are the same as those experienced with polymorphisms.

The study also reported that individuals with hormonal levels above 300 ng/L were treated with testosterone and polymorphisms in the first week of treatment.

"The main cause, and not the biological cause, of testosterone-dependent symptoms is the low clearance time for anabolic hormones and the delayed onset of adrenal activation," said co-author Dr. Andrew C. Scholz, M.D., PhD, a professor of medical and biomedical sciences at Rutgers University and one of the study's authors.

While other studies have shown a delayed onset of cortisol release during testosterone withdrawal, the investigators note that testosterone withdrawal often lasts 30 minutes longer than that found with polymorphisms.

Another possibility, Dr. Scholz said, is "how testosterone stimulates the pineal gland to take over the pathway" of testosterone binding to cortisol.

Previous research linked hormonal level with adverse events, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, some of which are caused by abnormal levels of other hormone.

"There have been two years of ongoing studies, with no significant conclusions," Dr. Scholz said. "It's too early to say the same thing. As an individual, this is an important research field and there are many other possible explanations for this. It's something we need to research further."
